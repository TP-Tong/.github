# BIGAI X THU Servers 101

## Users Guide

### Basic Information

Please contact [Yuyang Li](mailto:i@aidenli.net) for the Server List Google Docs. Note that you can only access them

- with BIGAI VPNs - for servers at "BIGAI 3F"
- at Central Building Room 501 - for servers at "THU Central 501"



### Preliminaries

To make sure that you're capable of using a server for computation, it's suggested that you go through several stuffs as preliminaries. Remember that it's common to be frustrated dealing with a command line Linux, but you will master it after try-and-errors. Good luck!



#### Linux

Instead of fully learning Linux, you can just go through:

- [An Intro to Linux](https://www.runoob.com/linux/linux-intro.html)
- [Linux System Contents](https://www.runoob.com/linux/linux-system-contents.html)
- [Remote Login (with PuTTY)](https://www.runoob.com/linux/linux-remote-login.html)
  - Note that you can also login with `ssh` command or other softwares like Termius and VSCode
- [File Attributes and Permissions](https://www.runoob.com/linux/linux-file-attr-permission.html)
- [[Vi/Vim](https://www.runoob.com/linux/linux-vim.html)](https://www.runoob.com/linux/linux-file-attr-permission.html)



#### Conda

You should work in virtual environments to isolate packages among your projects to avoid bad dependencies. You can go through:

- [An Intro to Anaconda](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/351348108)

> The latest Anaconda installer can be found on the server. See [Useful Resources](##Useful Resources)



#### SSH

You need SSH to login to the server. You can go through this [SSH guide](https://wangdoc.com/ssh/).



### Login

Use SSH to login to the server:

```shell
ssh USERNAME@HOSTNAME.gpu.bigai.aidenli.net
```

Note that you should change the `USERNAME` and `HOSTNAME` to your account name and the server hostname. E.g. To login to the server `snape` with account `yuyang`, use:

```shell
ssh yuyang@snape.gpu.bigai.aidenli.net
```



## Tips

### Changing Mirrors

Changing mirrors helps boost your package installation with conda, pip, etc, for they download data. Typically we show ways of switching to [TUNA](https://tuna.moe)'s mirrors.

#### Anaconda

We show a common way of [switching to TUNA's Anaconda mirror](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/anaconda/).



### Pip (pipi)

We show a common way of  [switching to TUNA's pypi mirror](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/pypi/).
